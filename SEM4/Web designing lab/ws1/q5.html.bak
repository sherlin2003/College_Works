<h2 align='right'><u>J . K. Rowling</u> </h2>
<p> <u> Harry James Potter </u> was an  <i> <b> English half-blood wizard </i> </b>, and one of the most famous wizards of modern times. The only child and son of  <i> <b> James and Lily Potter  </i> </b>  , Harry's birth was overshadowed by a <i> prophecy </i>, naming either himself or Neville Longbottom as the one with the power to vanquish  <i> <b> Lord Voldemort  </i> </b> , the most powerful and feared Dark Wizard in the world. After half of the prophecy was reported to Voldemort, courtesy of  <i> <b>  Severus Snape  </i> </b> , Harry was chosen as the target due to his many similarities with the Dark Lord. In turn, this caused the  <i> <b> Potter family  </i> </b> to go into hiding. </p>

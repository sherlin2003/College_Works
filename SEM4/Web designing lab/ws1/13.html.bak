  <h1>JUST LIKE MAGIC</h1>
  <hr width="100%">
  <p>Magic, sometimes spelled magick is the application of beliefs, rituals or actions employed   in the belief that they can manipulate natural or supernatural beings and forces.It is a category into   which have been placed various beliefs and practices sometimes considered separate from both religion  and science.Although connotations have varied from positive to negative at times throughout history,  magic "continues to have an important religious and medicinal role in many cultures today".Within Western  culture, magic has been linked to ideas of the Other ,foreignness, and primitivism; indicating   that it is "a powerful marker of cultural difference" and likewise,   a non-modern phenomenon. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,  Western intellectuals perceived the practice of magic to be a sign of a primitive mentality   and also commonly attributed it to marginalised groups of people./p>
